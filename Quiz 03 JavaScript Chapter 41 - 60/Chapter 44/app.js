// Commenting In JavaScript

// Commenting in JavaScript is an essential practice for developers to annotate their code, providing context, explanations, and documentation within the script. Comments are lines of text that are ignored by the JavaScript interpreter, serving solely for human readers. They enhance code readability, making it easier for other developers (including the original coder) to understand the purpose, functionality, and logic behind different parts of the codebase. Comments can describe the intent of specific functions or algorithms, detail complex logic, flag potential issues or TODOs for future reference, and even offer insights into the code's structure or design choices. In essence, commenting in JavaScript fosters collaboration, maintenance, and comprehension of codebases, contributing to overall software quality and developer efficiency.
